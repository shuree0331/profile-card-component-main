- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I have learned to combine multiple background images and position them.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
{
  background-image: url('./images/bg-pattern-top.svg'), url('./images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg');
        background-position: top -400px left -150px, right -150px bottom -500px;
}
```


### Continued development

Need more practice for combining images.
